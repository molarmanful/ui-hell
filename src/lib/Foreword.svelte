      Dear Visitor,
    </p>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a creative technologist, which basically means I'm an
      artist, a programmer, and everything in between. One of the things I love
      to do as part of my practice is to make art from websites &mdash; web
      art.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a morbid fascination with weird websites, especially those with
      styles deemed "unconventional" by the masses. What initially inspired me
      this time, however, was the opposite: tools and practices adopted by
      designers, developers, and engineers behind the <strong>BIG WEB</strong>.
      Microservices Architecture&trade;; Serverless Computing&trade;; Software
      as a Service&trade;. Technologies that every respectable company, from
      the behemothest behemoths to the most ungerminated startups, seeks to
      exploit in their quest for the Holy Grail of Rapid Infinite Scaling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, scaling isn't free. It's <em>very</em> far from free.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giants atop the <strong>BIG WEB</strong> have long been too giant for
      their own good, let alone ours. And yet even they still grow. When
      companies sacrifice to the altar of greed such petty concerns as "ethical
      responsibility" and "not doing shitty things," we suffer. Cobalt mining,
      noise pollution, body dysphoria, disinformation &mdash; the post-digital
      age is miserable. What's worse is that:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Most of us benefit in some way from the suffering of others through
        convenience, financial gain, or entertainment.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's far easier to just dissociate from or outright ignore the
        suffering in favor of the perceived benefits.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This website began, like most of my projects, as a little experiment in
      creating chaotic generative art from structured UI components. But from
      the start, I found that this format also served as a cathartic outlet for
      my long-standing frustrations and annoyances with the <strong>BIG
        WEB</strong>. Over time, the project has evolved to reflect this larger
      personal significance.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's pretty insane to see how capable browsers have become at handling
      these website thingamabobs; the evolution of web standards over time has
      allowed for a great degree of freedom in how I approach web art. Freedom
      is great, but not everyone might appreciate what I've made. This website
      may contain mildly disturbing content including &mdash; but not limited
      to &mdash; the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Expletives</li>
      <li>Dumb Memes</li>
      <li>UI/UX travesties</li>
      <li>Half-incoherent ramblings</li>
      <li>Anti-establishment rhetoric</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If any of the above disturb you, then it may do you well to leave this site now &mdash; no hard feelings!
      Otherwise...
    </p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>ui-hell</strong>; please enjoy your stay.
