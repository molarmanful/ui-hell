      Dear Visitor,
    </p>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a creative technologist, which basically means I'm an
      artist, a programmer, and everything in between. One of the things I love
      to do as part of my practice is to make art from websites &mdash; web
      art.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a morbid fascination with weird websites, especially those with
      styles deemed "unconventional" by the masses. What initially inspired me
      this time, however, was the opposite: tools and practices adopted by
      designers, developers, and engineers behind the <strong>BIG WEB</strong>.
      Microservices Architecture&trade;; Serverless Computing&trade;; Software
      as a Service&trade;. Technologies that every respectable company, from the
      behemothest behemoths to the most ungerminated startups, seeks to exploit
      in their quest for the Holy Grail of Rapid Infinite Scaling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, scaling isn't free. It's <em>very</em> far from free.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tech giants have long been too giant for their own good, let alone ours.
      And yet they still grow. When the giants sacrifice to the altar of greed
      such petty concerns as "ethical responsibility" and "not doing shitty
      things," we suffer. Cobalt mining, noise pollution, body dysphoria,
      disinformation &mdash; the post-digital age is miserable. What's worse is
      that:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Significant portions of us benefit in some way from the suffering of
        others through convenience, financial gain, or entertainment.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's far easier to just dissociate from or outright ignore such
        suffering in favor of the perceived benefits.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
      It's insane what "They" let us undeserving mortals do with these website
      thingamabobs; but I'm not really one to complain <em>too</em> much.
      Freedom is great, but not everyone might appreciate what I've made. If
      any of the following disturbs you:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Expletives</li>
      <li>UI/UX travesties</li>
      <li>Half-incoherent ramblings</li>
      <li>Anti-establishment rhetoric</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It may do you well to leave this site now &mdash; no hard feelings!
      Otherwise...
    </p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>ui-hell</strong>; please enjoy your stay.
